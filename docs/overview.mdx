> **Status:** Prototype  
> **Goal:** Simple, open-source auto-watering system that anyone can build and experiment with.

The **Mechaxil Smart Auto-Watering Pot** is a compact system for keeping a single plant automatically watered.

It uses a <GlossaryTerm term="Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor" /> connected to a <GlossaryTerm term="Development board of choice" /> running <GlossaryTerm term="MicroPython" />.  
When the soil gets dry, the controller drives a <GlossaryTerm term="MOSFET Module" /> with a gentle <GlossaryTerm term="PWM" /> soft-start, opening a small <GlossaryTerm term="DC Valve" /> or pump and letting water flow from a 3D-printed tank into the pot.

## Kit will be available soon!

## Key features

- <GlossaryTerm term="Development board of choice" /> + <GlossaryTerm term="MicroPython" /> firmware  
- <GlossaryTerm term="Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor" />
- <GlossaryTerm term="PWM" /> soft-start valve control to reduce inrush current and brown-outs  
- <GlossaryTerm term="RGB LED" /> or a regular <GlossaryTerm term="LED" /> feedback
- 3D-printable tank and electronics enclosure

## Mechanical design

All parts are designed to be printable on a typical <GlossaryTerm term="FDM 3D Printing" /> with a 0.4 mm nozzle.

**Recommended materials:** <GlossaryTerm term="PETG" /> or <GlossaryTerm term="ASA" /> (for better water and heat resistance than <GlossaryTerm term="PLA" />, altough it works just as well).

| Part | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Tank | 200-500 ml reservoir | Watertight print, 2-3 mm walls, ≥4 perimeters, optional epoxy sealing inside |
| Electronics box | Small enclosure for the controller + <GlossaryTerm term="MOSFET" /> | Cable holes high on the wall, lid screwed or clipped in place |

STL and CAD files will be published together with this documentation once the v0.1 hardware is fully validated.

## Project goals

1. Serve as the **first Mechaxil open kit**: small, fully documented, reproducible.  
2. Teach fundamentals of analog sensing, <GlossaryTerm term="PWM" /> power control and safe power distribution.
