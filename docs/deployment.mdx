This page covers the practical steps to install, test and maintain the smart auto-watering pot in real use.

## Pre-deployment checklist

Before putting the system on a live plant, confirm:

- The moisture sensor is wired correctly and returns sensible <GlossaryTerm term="ADC" /> values.  
- The valve or pump turns on and off as expected under firmware control.  
- All grounds are connected together.  
- The tank and hose routing have been leak-tested.  
- You have set `DRY_THRESHOLD` and `WET_THRESHOLD` according to your soil.

## Installation steps

1. **Place the tank** on the pot, or on a stable surface next to it.  
2. **Insert the moisture sensor** into the soil, near the root zone, at a consistent depth. Avoid pushing it against the pot wall.  
3. **Mount the Electronics (Enclosure)** far from the tank so a leak cannot reach it.  
4. **Plug in the <GlossaryTerm term="USB Wall Power Supply" />** (5 V, ≥ 2 A) to power the <GlossaryTerm term="MT3608" />.  
5. Watch the system through the first watering cycles and check that:
   - The <GlossaryTerm term="LED" /> colors or state match the expected states.  
   - The soil is not being over-watered.  
   - There are no leaks or drips from fittings or printed parts.

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance keeps the system reliable:

| Frequency | Action |
|----------:|--------|
| Weekly    | Check tank water level and top up as needed. |
| Monthly   | Visually inspect printed parts for cracks, hose connections for looseness, and the valve/pump for unusual noise. |
| 3-6 months| Re-run the calibration procedure if soil composition or potting mix changes, or if behaviour drifts. |

## Behaviour and fail-safes

- On power loss, the valve or pump is off by default.  
- The firmware limits each watering event to a short duration (`WATER_TIME_SEC`) to reduce the chance of flooding.  
- If you notice the system watering too often or not enough, adjust thresholds and intervals rather than trying to compensate by changing tank size.
