## Project Summary

This marks the conclusion of the **Smart Auto-Watering Pot** project — a compact, open, and modifiable system built to make plant care simpler.  
The design shows how a small embedded setup can measure soil moisture, make decisions autonomously, and actuate a water source — all while staying approachable for learning and tinkering.

Through this documentation, you've covered:

- How to assemble and wire the components  
- How to calibrate and tune the sensor  
- How to deploy and maintain the system in real use  
- How the firmware logic works internally

Every section is meant to be transparent and reproducible — from firmware to 3D parts and <GlossaryTerm term="BOM" /> — so you can freely adapt it to your own plants, enclosures, or microcontrollers.

## Contribute & Improve

Like most **Mechaxil** projects, this one is open-core and community-driven.  
If you've built it, modified it, or found a smarter approach — please share it with others!

- **Have an idea or improvement?**  
  Open an issue or discussion on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mechaxil/smart-auto-watering-pot) or just comment bellow (it straight go to discussions!).

- **Built a variant?**  
  Share your photos, updated firmware, or modified parts — they will appear in community builds section send it to us over Discord or any social media platform using ```#mechaxil```.

- **Found a bug or quirk?**  
  Document it or submit a fix. Even calibration notes help others fine-tune their systems.

Your feedback and experiments help shape the next iteration of Mechaxil's maker-friendly ecosystem.
